The prediction of tissue specific active regulatory regions in the human genome is a relevant problem in Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology. Indeed only when regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, are active in a specific cell the transcription factors and the molecular machinery can exert their role to regulate the expression of specific genes. This project develops deep neural models that try predict whether specific non-coding regulatory regions (e.g. a promoter or an enhancer) are active or not in a specific cell, using the nucleotide sequences of DNA and the epigenetic data associated with each regulatory region.
